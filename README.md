Nagasai Chandra, Teja Kalvakolanu, Michael Fekadu

## [Live Demo][1]

## [Documentation][2]

## Getting Started

### 1. [Install Docker][3]

### 2. [Install Docker-Compose][4]

> Note: The previous step may have included the `docker-compose` binary depending on your operating system.

### 3. Run all the services

The following command will run Rasa, the IRC worker bot, and the ElasticSearch service (the chatbot's memory):

```
docker-compose up
```

> Note: ElasticSearch needs a lot of memory. If it crashes, try increasing docker's memory allocation to >= 4GB.
